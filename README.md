# 🧠 GenAI

A personal learning repository to explore and understand the fundamentals of **Generative AI (GenAI)** using modern tools and frameworks.

## 📌 Purpose

This repo is a hands-on learning space where I experiment with and document my understanding of GenAI concepts. It includes basic code snippets, examples, and small projects as I learn how to work with:

- **Prompt engineering**
- **Language models**
- **Memory in agents**
- **LangChain and LangGraph frameworks**

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python
- 🔗 [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- 🕸️ [LangGraph](https://docs.langgraph.dev/)
- ✍️ Prompt engineering
- 🧠 Memory modules

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repo contains a growing collection of code and notes, such as:

- `prompts/` – Experiments with different prompt techniques
- `memory/` – Exploring stateful LLM interactions
- `langchain_examples/` – Using LangChain for building LLM-powered apps
- `langraph_examples/` – Graph-based workflows with LangGraph
